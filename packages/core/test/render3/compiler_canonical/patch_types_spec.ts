 * Below is a function which should be generated right next to the `@NgModule` which
 * imports types which have `.metadata.json` files.
 *
 * # JIT Mode
 * - Because the `ngPatch_CompiledWithIvyModule` is invoked all parts get patched.
 *
 * # AOT Mode
 * - Build Optimizer detects `@__BUILD_OPTIMIZER_COLOCATE__` annotation and moves the
 * code from the current location to the destination.
 * - The resulting `ngPatch_CompiledWithIvyModule` becomes empty and eligible for tree-shaking.
 * - Uglify removes the `ngPatch_CompiledWithIvyModule` since it is empty.
 *
 * # AOT Closure Mode
 * - Option A: not supported. (Preferred option)
 *   - Externally very few people use closure they will just have to wait until all of their
 *     libraries are Ivy.
 *   - Internally (g3) we build from source hence everyone switches to Ivy at the same time.
 * - Option B: Write a closure pass similar to Build Optimizer which would move the code.
